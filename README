TimeCop Version 0.61ÃŸ

You want to know, how much time you spend in front of your computer?
You want to know, how often your BeBox crashes?

So you can use TimeCop to write a protocol of your computer sessions.
TimeCop can show you the protocol in several statistics.

How to install:

Copy TimeCop on a place, where you love it. Then you should change your UserBootscript in a way, that the "TimeCop_daemon" is started everey time you use your computer.

For example. The TimeCop-Folder is:

/boot/home/TimeCop

then insert this line to your /boot/home/config/boot/UserBootskript

~/TimeCop/TimeCop_daemon &

Thats all.

The daemon writes now a protocolfile which is named: "/var/log/TimeCop.log"

So i hope, you have much fun with my first Applikation
